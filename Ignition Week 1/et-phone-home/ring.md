7) You're stuck in an elevator with a famous person of any discipline, currently living or long deceased. Who would you get stuck in an elevator with, and what would you talk about?

    I'd want to get stuck with Sara Bareilles, and sing with her instead of talking. Who needs to talk when
    you can make music instead?
